## OUTPUTS (Sprint 5 Deliverable Contract)

Produce three named files in a run-scoped directory:

```
runs/YYYY-MM-DD-<domain-slug>-site-audit[-<mode>]/
  analysis.md       (REQUIRED) — fill template: templates/deliverables/analysis-report.md
  marketing.md      (REQUIRED) — fill template: templates/deliverables/marketing-report.md
  data.json         (REQUIRED) — validates against: templates/deliverables/aimpactscanner-data.schema.json
```

Phase deliverables (executive summary, technical audit, content audit, action plan) are now sections WITHIN `analysis.md`, not standalone files.

**AI Search lens (Constitution rule 3)**: both AI Search Readiness AND Traditional SEO scorecards required in `analysis.md` and `data.json`. The schema enforces this — `data.json` will fail validation if the AI scorecard is missing.

**Backlog integration (Sprint 9)**:
- READ `seo-backlog.md` before producing the fix list (Constitution rule 1 — don't re-identify items already tracked)
- For each NEW finding not already in the backlog: append to `seo-backlog.md` under "Open items" with status=`identified`, stable ID, source run reference
- For findings that match existing backlog items: cross-reference the ID in `analysis.md` rather than creating a duplicate

**Roadmap touch (Sprint 9)**:
- READ `seo-roadmap.md` if it exists; tag each fix in analysis.md with the roadmap theme it supports (or "no theme" if none applies)
- Update the "Current state" section of `seo-roadmap.md` with this run's scorecards and open backlog count
- Do NOT rewrite themes or strategic objectives — those are quarterly/strategic

**Coordinator verification**: confirm all three files exist on filesystem before marking mission complete. Append a one-line pointer to this run in `seo-evidence.md` so future missions can read prior findings (Constitution rule 1).
