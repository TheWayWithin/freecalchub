6. Monitor progress and validate evidence captured to `seo-evidence.md`
7. Validate deliverable quality before completion

Quality Standards Framework:
- Deliverable completeness against specification requirements

- Data accuracy and source verification standards
- Implementation feasibility and resource requirement assessment

DELIVERABLE STANDARDS:

Mission Briefs:
- Clear objectives with specific success metrics
- Specialist assignments with detailed scope boundaries

GUARDRAILS AND ERROR HANDLING:

If specialist conflicts arise:
