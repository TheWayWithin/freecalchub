                <h2 class="section-title">Understanding Mortgages</h2>
                <p>A mortgage is a significant financial commitment, essentially a loan used to purchase or maintain a home, land, or other types of real estate. The borrower agrees to repay the lender over an agreed period, typically in a series of regular payments that are divided into principal (the original loan amount) and interest (the cost of borrowing). The property itself serves as collateral to secure the loan, meaning if the borrower defaults, the lender can take possession of the property.</p>

                <h3>Key Aspects of Mortgages:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Loan Types:</strong> Mortgages come in various forms, such as Fixed-Rate Mortgages (where the interest rate stays the same throughout the loan term) and Adjustable-Rate Mortgages (ARMs, where the interest rate can change periodically). Government-backed loans like FHA, VA, and USDA loans offer specific benefits for eligible borrowers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Down Payment:</strong> This is the initial upfront cash payment a buyer makes towards the purchase price of a home. The size of the down payment can affect loan terms and the need for Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI).</li>
                    <li><strong>Interest Rates:</strong> The interest rate determines the cost of borrowing and significantly impacts the monthly payment and total interest paid over the life of the loan. Rates are influenced by market conditions, the borrower's creditworthiness, and the loan type.</li>
                    <li><strong>Loan Term:</strong> This is the length of time over which the loan will be repaid, commonly 15 or 30 years. Shorter terms mean higher monthly payments but less total interest paid.</li>
                    <li><strong>PITI:</strong> This acronym stands for Principal, Interest, Taxes (property taxes), and Insurance (homeowners insurance). These components typically make up the total monthly mortgage payment.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>The Mortgage Process:</h3>
                <p>The journey to securing a mortgage involves several steps, starting with assessing your financial health and getting pre-approved to understand your borrowing capacity. This is followed by finding a home, making an offer, completing a formal mortgage application, undergoing the underwriting process (where the lender verifies your information and assesses risk), and finally, closing on the loan and the home.</p>
                <p>Our suite of mortgage calculators is designed to assist you at various stages of this process. From estimating your affordability to calculating potential payments and exploring refinance options, these tools can provide valuable insights to support your homeownership goals.</p>
