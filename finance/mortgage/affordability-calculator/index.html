                <h2 class="section-title">Understanding Mortgage Affordability</h2>
                <p>Mortgage affordability is determined by how much a lender believes you can comfortably repay each month. They primarily use debt-to-income (DTI) ratios. The <strong>28/36 rule</strong> is a common benchmark: your housing costs (PITI + HOA) shouldn't exceed 28% of your gross monthly income (front-end ratio), and your total debts (including housing) shouldn't exceed 36% of your gross monthly income (back-end ratio). Some lenders may allow higher ratios, up to 43% or more for the back-end, depending on your overall financial profile.</p>
                <p>Key factors influencing affordability include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Income and Employment Stability:</strong> Lenders look for stable, verifiable income.</li>
                    <li><strong>Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI):</strong> A lower DTI generally means better affordability.</li>
                    <li><strong>Credit Score and History:</strong> Higher scores typically lead to lower interest rates.</li>
                    <li><strong>Down Payment Amount:</strong> A larger down payment reduces the loan amount and monthly payments.</li>
                    <li><strong>Interest Rates and Loan Terms:</strong> Market rates and the length of your loan significantly impact payments.</li>
                    <li><strong>Property Taxes and Homeowners Insurance:</strong> These vary by location and add to your monthly housing cost.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Improve Your Credit Score:</strong> Pay bills on time and reduce credit card balances.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pay Down Existing Debt:</strong> Lowering your DTI can significantly boost affordability.</li>
                    <li><strong>Save for a Larger Down Payment:</strong> This reduces the loan principal and monthly payments.</li>
                    <li><strong>Shop Around for Mortgages:</strong> Compare rates and terms from multiple lenders.</li>
                    <li><strong>Consider Different Loan Types:</strong> FHA, VA, or USDA loans might offer more favorable terms if you qualify.</li>
                    <li><strong>Look into First-Time Homebuyer Programs:</strong> These can offer down payment assistance or grants.</li>
                    <li><strong>Consider a Co-borrower:</strong> Adding another qualified borrower can increase your combined income and borrowing power, but also means shared responsibility.</li>
                    <li><strong>Extend Your Loan Term:</strong> A longer term (e.g., 30 years vs. 15) lowers monthly payments but increases total interest paid.</li>

                <h2 class="section-title">Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Not Accounting for All Homeownership Costs:</strong> Beyond PITI, consider maintenance, repairs, utilities, and potential HOA special assessments.</li>
                    <li><strong>Borrowing the Maximum Amount Offered:</strong> Just because you *can* borrow a certain amount doesn't mean you *should*. Ensure the payment is comfortable for your lifestyle.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ignoring Future Life Changes:</strong> Consider potential changes in income, family size, or career that could affect your ability to pay.</li>
                    <li><strong>Not Shopping Around for the Best Mortgage Rate:</strong> Even a small difference in rates can save thousands over the life of the loan.</li>
                    <li><strong>Overlooking the Impact of Your Credit Score:</strong> A low score can significantly increase your interest rate and reduce affordability.</li>
                    <li><strong>Draining Savings for the Down Payment:</strong> Ensure you have an emergency fund left after closing costs and down payment.</li>

                        <p>Determining affordability on a $70,000 income involves looking at your gross monthly income (approx. $5,833), the 28/36 rule (housing costs <28% GMI, total debt <36% GMI), your down payment, existing debts, credit score, current interest rates, loan term, property taxes, and insurance.

                        <p>The 28/36 rule suggests your total housing expenses (PITI + HOA) shouldn't exceed 28% of your gross monthly income (front-end ratio), and your total monthly debt obligations (including housing) shouldn't exceed 36% of your gross monthly income (back-end ratio). Lenders use this to assess your ability to manage payments.</p>

                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>A higher credit score generally qualifies you for lower interest rates, reducing your monthly mortgage payment and increasing the home price you can afford. It can also provide access to better loan terms and lower PMI costs.</p>

                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>For a $400,000 house, a 20% down payment ($80,000) avoids PMI on conventional loans. However, FHA loans might require as little as 3.5% ($14,000), and VA/USDA loans may require 0%. The down payment affects your loan amount and monthly payments.</p>

                        <p>Most lenders prefer a DTI of 43% or less. Conventional loans often cap around 43-50% with compensating factors. FHA loans may go up to 43-50%+. VA loans are more flexible but often prefer <41% and consider residual income. USDA loans typically require <41%.</p>

                        <p>Property taxes and homeowners insurance (T&I) are part of your monthly PITI payment. Higher T&I costs increase your PITI, reducing the principal and interest portion you can afford, thus lowering the overall home price you can manage for a given total payment.</p>

                        <p>Yes, HOA fees are a recurring monthly expense and must be included. Lenders add HOA fees to your PITI when calculating your debt-to-income ratios, which directly impacts your affordability.</p>

                        <p>A general guideline is 2.5 to 4 times your gross annual income. However, this varies greatly based on your down payment, debts, interest rates, credit score, and local property taxes/insurance. Use an affordability calculator for a personalized estimate.</p>

                        <p>Pre-qualification is an informal estimate based on self-reported data, without a hard credit check.
