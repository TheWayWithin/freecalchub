Each month, a portion of your payment goes toward the principal, and the rest goes toward interest. As you pay down the principal, more of each payment goes toward the principal and less toward interest. This process is called amortization. The formula used is: Monthly Interest = (Annual Interest Rate รท 12) ร Outstanding Principal Balance."

Some payments may also include homeowners association (HOA) fees if applicable to your property."

A common guideline is that your monthly housing costs (including mortgage, taxes, and insurance) should not exceed 28% of your gross monthly income, and your total debt payments (including your mortgage and all other debt) should not exceed 36% of your gross monthly income."

              "text": "Making extra payments toward your mortgage principal can significantly reduce the total interest you pay over the life of the loan and help you pay off your mortgage earlier. Even small additional payments can make a big difference over time. For example, paying an extra $100 per month on a $250,000, 30-year mortgage at 4% interest could help you pay off your loan about 4 years earlier and save approximately $30,000 in interest."

              "text": "An amortization schedule is a table that shows the breakdown of each mortgage payment into principal and interest over the life of the loan. It details how much of each payment goes toward reducing the principal balance and how much goes toward interest. The schedule also shows the remaining loan balance after each payment. In the early years of a mortgage, a larger portion of each payment goes toward interest, while in later years, more goes toward principal."

It accounts for principal, interest, property taxes, homeowners insurance, and optional inputs like PMI and HOA fees. However, the results should be considered estimates and may not reflect the exact terms offered by specific lenders. Actual loan terms, interest rates, and fees can vary based on your credit score, loan-to-value ratio, and other factors."

              "@type": "Answer",
              "text": "Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI) is an insurance policy that protects the lender if you default on your mortgage payments. PMI is typically required when you make a down payment of less than 20% on a conventional loan. The cost of PMI varies based on your loan amount, credit score, and down payment, but it generally ranges from 0.3% to 1.5% of your loan amount annually."

              "text": "The choice between a 15-year and 30-year mortgage depends on your financial goals and situation. A 15-year mortgage typically offers lower interest rates, faster equity building, and less total interest paid, but has higher monthly payments. A 30-year mortgage typically offers lower monthly payments, more flexibility for other financial goals, and potential to invest the difference elsewhere."

In many cases, these costs are collected monthly by your mortgage servicer and held in an escrow account, from which the servicer pays your property tax bills and insurance premiums when they're due. This ensures these important expenses are paid on time."
